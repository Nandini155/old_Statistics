Steps to Solve Problems on Central Limit Theorem
Problems of Central Limit Theorem that involves >, < or between can be solved by the following steps:

    Step 1: First identify the >, < associated with sample size, population size, mean and variance in the problem. Also there can be ‘betwee; associated with range of two numbers.
    Step 2: Draw a Graph with Mean as Centre
    Step 3: Find the Z-Score using the formula
    Step 4: Refer to the Z table to find the value of Z obtained in the previous step.
    Step 5: If the problem involves ‘>’ subtract the Z score from 0.5; if the problem involves ‘<‘ add 0.5 to the Z score and if the problem involves ‘between’ then perform only step 3 and 4.
    Step 6: The Z score value is found along X‾X
    Step 7: Convert the decimal value obtained in all three cases to decimal.
