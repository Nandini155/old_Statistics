Assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem is valid for the following conditions:

    The drawing of the sample from the population should be random.
    The drawing of the sample should be independent of each other.
    The sample size should not exceed ten percent of the total population when sampling is done without replacement.
    Sample Size should be adequately large.
    CLT only holds for a population with finite variance.

Steps to Solve Problems on Central Limit Theorem

Problems of Central Limit Theorem that involves >, < or between can be solved by the following steps:

    Step 1: First identify the >, < associated with sample size, population size, mean and variance in the problem. Also there can be ‘betwee; associated with range of two numbers.
    Step 2: Draw a Graph with Mean as Centre
    Step 3: Find the Z-Score using the formula
    Step 4: Refer to the Z table to find the value of Z obtained in the previous step.
    Step 5: If the problem involves ‘>’ subtract the Z score from 0.5; if the problem involves ‘<‘ add 0.5 to the Z score and if the problem involves ‘between’ then perform only step 3 and 4.
    Step 6: The Z score value is found along X‾X
    Step 7: Convert the decimal value obtained in all three cases to decimal.

Central Limit Theorem Applications

Central Limit Theorem is generally used to predict the characteristics of a population from a set of sample. It can be applied in various fields. Some of the applications Central Limit Theorem are mentioned below:

    Central Limit Theorem is used by Economist and Data Scientist to draw conclusion about population to make a statistical model.
    Central Limit Theorem is used by Biologists to make accurate predictions about the characteristics of the population from set of sample.
    Manufacturing Industries use Central Limit Theorem to predict overall defective items produced by selecting random products from a sample.
    Central Limit Theorem is used in surveys to predict the characteristics of the population or to predict the average response of the population by analyzing a sample of obtained responses.
    CLT can be used in Machine Learning to make conclusion about the performance of the model.
