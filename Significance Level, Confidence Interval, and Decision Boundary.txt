How Significance Level, Confidence Interval, and Decision Boundary Work Together
## Choose the Significance Level (Œ±)

Œ± is the probability of making a Type I error‚Äîrejecting the null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) when it is actually true. 

Example: Œ± = 0.05 (5%).
## Determine the Confidence Level (1 ‚àí Œ±)

The confidence level is 1 ‚àí Œ±.

Example: If Œ± = 0.05, the confidence level is 0.95 (95%).

This means we are 95% confident that the true population parameter lies within the confidence interval.

## Calculate the Confidence Interval (CI)

The CI is a range based on your sample data where the true population parameter is likely to fall, with a confidence level of 95%, for example.
## Set the Decision Boundary

The decision boundary corresponds to the critical values of the distribution. For example, in a two-tailed test with Œ± = 0.05, the critical values on a standard normal distribution are ¬±1.96.
Any test statistic that falls beyond these critical values (outside the CI) will result in rejecting H‚ÇÄ.
The critical values are the edges of the CI. In our case, the 95% CI lies between the two critical values (¬±1.96), and the tails contain the Œ± = 0.05 rejection region.
Now, How Does Hypothesis Testing Work Using the CI and Decision Boundary?
If the null hypothesis value (or test statistic) falls within the confidence interval:

This means the result is not significant, and we fail to reject H‚ÇÄ (i.e., we keep the null hypothesis).
In other words, the parameter lies within the decision boundary.
If the null hypothesis value (or test statistic) falls outside the confidence interval:

This means the result is statistically significant, and we reject H‚ÇÄ.
In other words, the parameter lies outside the decision boundary (in the rejection region, beyond the critical value).


Correct Interpretation 
We don‚Äôt "accept" the null hypothesis if the test statistic lies within the confidence interval. Instead, we say we "fail to reject" H‚ÇÄ because we don‚Äôt have strong enough evidence to reject it.
Null hypothesis is only rejected when the value lies outside the confidence interval.

Summary of the Correct Workflow
Choose Œ± (e.g., 0.05)
Find the confidence level: 
1‚àíùõº = 0.95
1‚àíŒ±=0.95 (95% confidence interval).

Set the decision boundary: Use critical values (like ¬±1.96) to determine the rejection region.
Evaluate the test statistic:
Within the CI ‚Üí Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ (result is not significant).
Outside the CI ‚Üí Reject H‚ÇÄ (result is significant).
