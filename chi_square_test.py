#How Payment Method Analysis Helps the Supermarket Reduces operational costs by optimizing payment infrastructure. 
#Enhances customer experience by matching the right payment options to specific purchase categories.
#Enables targeted promotions in partnership with banks or mobile payment providers. 
#Predicts customer behavior to personalize offerings and improve loyalty programs.
