Key Concepts of Log-Normal Distribution

Right Skewness:

A log-normal distribution is indeed characterized by its right skewness (positively skewed). This means that when you visualize the data distribution, you'll observe that the tail on the right side (higher values) is longer than the left side.
However, not all right-skewed distributions are log-normally distributed. Right skewness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a distribution to be classified as log-normal.

Definition:

A dataset is considered log-normally distributed if the logarithm of the data (usually the natural logarithm) is normally distributed. This means if you take the log of each data point and plot that, the resulting distribution should be a bell-shaped normal distribution.

Nature of Log-Normal Distribution:

Positive Values: Log-normal distributions can only contain positive values since the logarithm of zero or negative numbers is undefined.

Non-symmetrical: Log-normal distributions are inherently non-symmetrical (skewed to the right), which contrasts with normal distributions that are symmetrical.

Visualizing and Identifying Log-Normal Distribution

To determine whether a dataset is log-normally distributed, you can follow these steps:

Plot the Data: Create a histogram or density plot of your dataset.

If the data appears right-skewed, it might be log-normally distributed, but further analysis is required.
Log Transformation:

Apply a logarithmic transformation to your data (e.g., take the natural log).
Plot the transformed data. If the resulting histogram looks like a normal distribution (bell-shaped), your original data is log-normally distributed.
Statistical Tests:

You can use statistical tests (like the Shapiro-Wilk test) on the log-transformed data to assess whether it follows a normal distribution.
Summary
If your dataset is right-skewed, it could be log-normally distributed, but additional steps (like log transformation and normality checks) are needed to confirm this.
Simply having a right-skewed distribution does not automatically classify it as log-normal; it must specifically exhibit the property that its logarithm is normally distributed.
