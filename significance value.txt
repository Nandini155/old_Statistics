How to Choose the Significance Level (α)?
The choice of α depends on how serious the consequences are if you make the wrong decision (like falsely rejecting the null hypothesis, called a Type I error).

Common Choices for α:
0.05 (5%): A balanced level for many fields, like social sciences or marketing research.
0.01 (1%): Used when being more cautious, like in medical studies or clinical trials.
0.10 (10%): Used when you're okay with some uncertainty, like in exploratory research or pilot studies.

Summary
The significance level (α) isn’t always 0.05—it can change based on the field of study, consequences of error, and type of research.
0.01 is used for stricter studies (e.g., medical research).
0.10 is used for exploratory studies (e.g., early marketing tests).
Multiple tests may require adjusting α to avoid false positives.
In conclusion, α is flexible and should be chosen based on how much risk you are willing to accept for making an incorrect conclusion.
