The normal distribution and the log-normal distribution are two different types of probability distributions that have distinct characteristics and applications. While they are related in some ways, they have key differences that set them apart.

1. Basic Definitions
Normal Distribution: Also known as the Gaussian distribution, this is a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution that describes many naturally occurring phenomena, such as heights, IQ scores, and measurement errors. It is defined for all real numbers and characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).

X is said to follow a log-normal distribution if its natural logarithm,

2. Key Differences
1. Shape of the Distribution
Normal Distribution:

The normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, meaning the left and right sides of the distribution are mirror images.
The mean, median, and mode are all equal and occur at the same point.
It has a bell-shaped curve.
The tails extend infinitely in both directions, but the probability of extreme values diminishes rapidly.
Log-Normal Distribution:

The log-normal distribution is skewed to the right (positively skewed), meaning it has a longer tail on the right-hand side.
The mean, median, and mode are different. The mode (the most frequent value) is less than the median, which is less than the mean.
It has a right-skewed curve.
The distribution is only defined for positive values (i.e., 
𝑥
>
0
x>0) because the logarithm of a non-positive number is undefined or not real.
2. Range of Values
Normal Distribution:

The normal distribution can take any real value, from 
−
∞
−∞ to 
+
∞
+∞.
It is suitable for modeling variables that can take both positive and negative values (e.g., measurement errors, heights centered around a mean).
Log-Normal Distribution:

The log-normal distribution is only defined for positive values. That is, 
𝑋
>
0
X>0.
It is appropriate for modeling variables that cannot be negative and exhibit exponential growth or multiplicative processes (e.g., stock prices, incomes).
3. Mean, Median, and Mode
Normal Distribution:
The mean 
𝜇
μ, median, and mode are all the same and located at the center of the distribution.
The mean is given by 
𝜇
μ, and the standard deviation is 
𝜎
σ.
Log-Normal Distribution:
The mean, median, and mode are all different:
Mean: The mean of the log-normal distribution is 
exp
⁡
(
𝜇
+
𝜎
2
2
)
exp(μ+ 
2
σ 
2
 
​
 ).
Median: The median is 
exp
⁡
(
𝜇
)
exp(μ).
Mode: The mode is 
exp
⁡
(
𝜇
−
𝜎
2
)
exp(μ−σ 
2
 ).
The mean is typically greater than the median, which is greater than the mode due to the positive skew.
4. Symmetry vs. Skewness
Normal Distribution:

It is symmetric around the mean. The left side of the distribution mirrors the right side.
There is no skewness (skewness = 0).
Log-Normal Distribution:

It is right-skewed, meaning it has a long tail on the right-hand side.
Skewness is positive, and the distribution becomes more skewed as the variance 
𝜎
2
σ 
2
  increases.
5. Additive vs. Multiplicative Processes
Normal Distribution:

The normal distribution often models additive processes, where increments or changes are added to a variable (e.g., measurement errors, natural fluctuations).
For example, height differences among individuals might be normally distributed because these differences are the result of many small additive factors (genetic, environmental, etc.).
Log-Normal Distribution:

The log-normal distribution is typically used to model multiplicative processes, where changes in a variable are proportional (i.e., grow or shrink by percentages or ratios).
For example, stock prices follow a log-normal distribution because they change multiplicatively over time (a 10% increase followed by another 10% increase is multiplicative).
6. Examples of Usage
Normal Distribution:
Height of individuals
IQ scores
Errors in measurement
SAT or GRE scores
Average daily temperature fluctuations
Log-Normal Distribution:
Stock prices
Income distribution
Duration of tasks (e.g., completion times in project management)
Sizes of living organisms or biological variables
Rainfall amounts
3. Real-World Example to Illustrate the Difference
Let’s look at stock prices and height distribution to illustrate the difference between the two distributions:

Height Distribution (Normal Distribution):
The heights of adult humans typically follow a normal distribution. For example, if the average height of a population is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm, most people will have heights clustered around 170 cm, with fewer people as you move away from that mean (either taller or shorter).
Since height can vary above and below the mean and the variations are additive (a person might be a certain number of cm taller or shorter than the average), the normal distribution models it well.
Stock Prices (Log-Normal Distribution):
Stock prices cannot be negative and usually follow a log-normal distribution. If you start with a stock price of $100, its future price could rise or fall based on percentage changes. Over time, these changes compound, so a 10% increase followed by a 10% decrease results in a net change that is not the same as adding or subtracting a fixed amount. Additionally, while prices can go up indefinitely, they are bounded below by zero, which is why the log-normal distribution is appropriate.
4. Relationship Between Normal and Log-Normal Distributions
A random variable 
𝑋
X is said to follow a log-normal distribution if its logarithm 
𝑌
=
log
⁡
(
𝑋
)
Y=log(X) follows a normal distribution.
In other words, if 
𝑌
∼
𝑁
(
𝜇

𝜎
2
)
Y∼N(μ,σ 
2
 ), then 
𝑋
=
𝑒
𝑌
X=e 
Y
  follows a log-normal distribution.
This relationship shows that a log-normal distribution is essentially an exponentiated version of the normal distribution. When we take the natural logarithm of a log-normally distributed variable, we end up with a normally distributed variable.
